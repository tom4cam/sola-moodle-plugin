<h2><?php echo $productfull; ?> Privacy Notice</h2>
<p><em>Last updated: <?php echo $today; ?>. Version 1.0.</em></p>

<h3>What <?php echo $product; ?> Is</h3>
<p><?php echo $product; ?> is <?php echo $inst; ?>'s AI powered learning coach, built into some courses. When <?php echo $product; ?> is available on a course, you will see a chat widget on the course pages. You can ask <?php echo $product; ?> questions about the material, get practice questions, plan your study schedule, and use voice features if your course has them enabled.</p>
<p><?php echo $product; ?> is not available on every course at <?php echo $inst; ?>. The decision to enable <?php echo $product; ?> on a course is made by the course developer.</p>

<h3>What Information <?php echo $product; ?> Collects</h3>
<p>When you use <?php echo $product; ?> on a course, <?php echo $inst; ?> records your messages, <?php echo $product; ?>'s responses, the course and time of each exchange, ratings and feedback you give, your study plan and reminder preferences if you create them, your chosen avatar, and a short profile summary that <?php echo $product; ?> generates from your conversations to personalize future sessions.</p>
<p><?php echo $product; ?> also collects standard technical data needed to operate the service: your Moodle user id, IP address, browser type, and a timestamp. <?php echo $product; ?> does not collect your full name, email address, home address, phone number (unless you give one for reminders), payment information, or government issued identifiers.</p>

<h3>How Your Information Is Used</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Answer your questions at the moment.</li>
    <li>Personalize <?php echo $product; ?>'s responses to you.</li>
    <li>Improve <?php echo $product; ?> itself, using anonymized and aggregated data.</li>
    <li>Detect and prevent abuse.</li>
    <li>Generate analytics that help course authors improve course materials. Analytics are anonymized before they reach a human reviewer.</li>
</ol>
<p><?php echo $inst; ?> does not sell your information. <?php echo $inst; ?> does not use your <?php echo $product; ?> conversations to market unrelated products to you.</p>

<h3>Who Sees Your Information</h3>
<p>To answer your questions, <?php echo $product; ?> works with an AI service (similar to ChatGPT or Claude) behind the scenes. Here's exactly what <?php echo $product; ?> shares with that service:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your first name</li>
    <li>A summary of the course material you're studying</li>
    <li>The last 10 messages from your current <?php echo $product; ?> conversation</li>
    <li>Your study plan, if you've created one</li>
    <li>Your profile summary, if you've created one</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what <?php echo $product; ?> never shares:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your last name</li>
    <li>Your email address</li>
    <li>Your Moodle username or ID number</li>
    <li>Your home address</li>
    <li>Any other information that could identify you personally</li>
</ul>
<p><?php echo $inst; ?> only uses AI services we have carefully reviewed and approved. Each one has a contract with <?php echo $inst; ?> that limits how they can use your information and forbids them from using your <?php echo $product; ?> conversations to train their AI.</p>

<h3>How Long <?php echo $product; ?> Keeps Your Information</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Your current conversation is stored for the duration of your course enrollment. Only the most recent 10 turns are ever sent to the AI model.</li>
    <li>Ratings, study plans, and reminders are retained until you remove them or end your course enrollment.</li>
    <li>Anonymized analytics are retained under <?php echo $inst; ?>'s Records Retention Policy and cannot be linked back to you.</li>
    <li>Audit and operational logs are retained for up to 365 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>When your <?php echo $inst; ?> user account is deleted, all <?php echo $product; ?> data tied to your user id is deleted within the same operation.</p>

<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Access.</strong> View your current conversation in the widget; download a complete copy of all <?php echo $product; ?> data from the <?php echo $product; ?> user settings page.</li>
    <li><strong>Download.</strong> The user settings page offers a "Download my <?php echo $product; ?> data" button that produces a structured file with all your <?php echo $product; ?> data.</li>
    <li><strong>Delete.</strong> The same page offers course level and global delete options. Deletion is immediate.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction.</strong> <?php echo $product; ?> conversations are raw transcripts and are not normally amended. If a derived record looks wrong, continue using <?php echo $product; ?> or contact <?php echo $inst; ?> at the address below.</li>
    <li><strong>Object or restrict.</strong> You do not have to use <?php echo $product; ?>. You can remove your data at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Portability.</strong> The download is in a standard JSON format and can be imported into other systems.</li>
    <li><strong>Complaint.</strong> Contact <?php echo $inst; ?>. Learners in the EU, UK, Switzerland, Brazil, or Canada may also complain to their national data protection authority.</li>
</ol>

<h3>International Learners</h3>
<p><?php echo $inst; ?> serves learners globally. If you are based in a region with specific data protection rules (GDPR, UK GDPR, LGPD, PIPEDA, Swiss FADP, CCPA), those rules apply to your <?php echo $product; ?> data. The lawful basis for processing is the performance of the education contract you have with <?php echo $inst; ?>, combined with <?php echo $inst; ?>'s legitimate interest in improving its education services.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p><?php echo $product; ?> lives inside <?php echo $inst; ?>'s Moodle platform, so you have to be logged in to use it. A few specific things we do to keep your information safe:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In transit:</strong> When your messages travel between your device and <?php echo $product; ?>, they are encrypted. That means if anyone tried to intercept them, they would only see scrambled code.</li>
    <li><strong>At rest:</strong> When your information is stored, it lives in <?php echo $inst; ?>'s Moodle database, protected by the same security controls <?php echo $inst; ?> uses for the rest of your student data.</li>
    <li><strong>If something goes wrong:</strong> If we ever detect a security incident that affects your <?php echo $product; ?> data, <?php echo $inst; ?> will notify you as required by law.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Children</h3>
<p><?php echo $product; ?> is available only to learners who meet the age requirements of the course they are enrolled in. <?php echo $inst; ?> does not knowingly collect <?php echo $product; ?> data from children under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<ul>
    <?php if ($contactemail !== ''): ?>
    <li><?php echo $inst; ?> Contact: <a href="mailto:<?php echo $contactemail; ?>"><?php echo $contactemail; ?></a></li>
    <?php endif; ?>
    <?php if ($privacyurl !== ''): ?>
    <li><?php echo $inst; ?> Privacy Page: <a href="<?php echo $privacyurl; ?>" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><?php echo $privacyurl; ?></a></li>
    <?php endif; ?>
    <li>Within <?php echo $product; ?>: open the widget, click the gear icon, open the Privacy and data section.</li>
</ul>
